# File Input and Output
All serious business applications require more data than would fit into main memory. They also depend on the ability to process data that is persistent and stored on a external device such as a disk drive.

C provides many functions in the header file `stdio.h` for writing to and reading from external devices.

C views a file as a continuous sequence of bytes. Each byte can be read individually.

There are two ways of writing data to a stream that represents a file.
- text
- binary.

Text data is written as a sequence of characters organized as lines (each line ends with a newline).
Binary data is written as series of bytes exactly as they appear in memory (image data, music encoding - not readable).

We can write any data we like to a file. Once a file has been written, it just consists of a series of bytes.

We ha e to understand the format of the file in order to read it. A sequence of 12 bytes in a binary file could be 12 characters, 12 8-bit signed integers, 12 8-bit unsigned integers, etc.
In binary mode, each and every byte of the file is accessible.

C programs automatically open three files on your behalf
- standard input - the normal input device for your system, usually the keyboard.
- standard output - usually the display screen.
- standard error - usually the display screen.

Standard input is the file that is read by getchar() and scanf().
Standard output is used by `putchar()`, `puts()`, and `printf()`.

Redirection causes other files to be recognized as the standard input or standard output.

The purpose of the standard error output file is to provide a logically distinct place to send error messages.

**A stream is an abstract representation of any external source or destination for data.**
- the keybard, the command lline on your display, and files on a disk are all examples of things we can work with as streams.
- The C library provides functions for reading and writing to or from data streams. We use the same input/output functions for reading and writing any external device that is mapped to a stream.

##Â Accesing files
Files on disk have a name and the rules for naming files are determined by the operating system. We may have to adjust the names depending on what OS the program is running.

A program references a file through a file pointer (or stream pointer, since it works on more than a file).
- We associate a file pointer with a file programmatically when the program runs.
- pointers can be reused to point to different files on different occasions.

A file pointer points to a struct oftype FILE that represents a stream. It contains information about the file.
- Whether we want to read or write or update the file.
- The address of the buffer in memory to be used for data.
- a pointer to the current position in the file for the next operation.
The above is all set via input/output file operations.


If we want to use several files simultaneously in a program, we have to create a separate file pointer for each file. We can only reuse the file pointer if we are reading and writing at different times. There is a limit to the number of open files we can have at one open time. We can look at the limit in the standard I/O library, which has a constant defined as `FOPEN_MAX`. It all depends on what operating system we are running on.
Usually we don't want to create and open a ton of files at once. Writing and reading the files is an expensive operation, because we are writing on the hard drive It is not as fast as writing to the memory, so it can cause the program to be less responsive.

## Opening a file
We associate a specific external file name with an internal pointer variable through a process referred to as opening a file, via the `fopen()` function. This returns the file pointer for a specific external file.

~~~c
FILE *fopen(const char * restrict name, const char * restrict mode);
~~~

The first argument to the function is a pointer to a string that is the name of the external file we want to process.
- We can specify the name explicitly or use a char poionter that contains the address of the character string that defines the file name.
- We can obtain the file name through the command line, as input from the user, or defined as a constant in our program.

The second argument to the fopen() function is a character string that represents the file mode. It specifies what we want to do with the file. A file mode specification is a character string between double quotes.

Assuming the call to `fopen()` is successful, te function returns a pointer of type `FILE*` that we can use to reference the file in further input/output operations using other functions in the ibrary.
If the file cannot be opened for some reason, `fopen()` returns `NULL`.

| Mode | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "w"  | Open a text file for write operations. If the file exists, its current contents are discarded.                                                     |
| "a"  | Open a text file for append operations. All writes are to the end of the file.                                                                     |
| "r"  | Open a text file for read operations.                                                                                                              |
| "w+" | Open a text file for update (reading and writing), first truncating the file to zero length if it exists or creating the file if it doesn't exist. |
| "a+" | Open a text file for update (reading and writing) appending to the end of the existing file, or creating the file if it does not yet exist.        |
| "r+" | Open a text file for update (for both reading and writing).                                                                                        |
